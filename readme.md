# SwiftUI OpenWeather One Call API library 


## OWOneCall

[**OWOneCall**](https://github.com/workingDog/OWOneCall) is a small Swift library to connect to the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) and retrieve the chosen weather data. Made easy to use with SwiftUI.

Provides for current, forecast and historical weather data through a single function call.

See **ContentView** for the example use. Note, you need to add your own `OpenWeather key` 
in the **ContentView**.

### Requirement

Requires a valid OpenWeather key, see:
